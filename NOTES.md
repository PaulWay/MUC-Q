# Implementation notes

This document stores all the ideas the design team has had for how this part
is to be layed out and connected to the PCB.

* Cut-out slots in the corners for decoupling caps
* Capacitors mounted on top of the part
* Land patterns close to each other
* Insufficient detail on pads to tell which are ground and which are rails
* PCIe positive pins on one side of the chip, negative on the other side
* VCC pins scattered randomly throughout the package
